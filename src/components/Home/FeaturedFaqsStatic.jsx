    ans: "Astrology is an ancient, science-backed system that decodes planetary and cosmic influences on human life. It goes beyond fortune-telling — it's a tool for self-awareness, decision-making, and personal growth. Online platforms have made this wisdom accessible, affordable, and convenient for everyone through birth chart analysis, daily horoscopes, personalized consultations, and practical remedies rooted in Vedic tradition.",

        Astrology has been observed and refined over thousands of years. It
        works because it's based on patterns — the same planetary cycles that
        influenced people centuries ago continue to shape our lives today. When

        interpreting a deeply personal cosmic map that reflects your

        specific to you, not generic.

        Astrology doesn't predict events like a script written in stone. Think
        of it more like a weather forecast — it shows likely conditions, not
        certainties. What it does very well is highlight patterns, timing, and
        tendencies in your life. Many people who consult astrologers on{" "}

        Astrology is the study of how celestial bodies — the Sun, Moon, and

        Both systems study planetary positions, but they differ in approach.
        Vedic astrology, rooted in ancient Indian tradition, uses the sidereal
        zodiac — based on actual star positions — and places heavy emphasis on
        the Moon sign, planetary periods (dashas), and karmic patterns. Western
        astrology uses the tropical zodiac — based on seasons — and focuses more
        on the Sun sign and psychological personality traits. At{" "}

        A birth chart, also called a Kundli or natal chart, is a snapshot of the
